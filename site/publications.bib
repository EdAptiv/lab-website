  abstract={In this paper we present a model for computerized adaptive practice and monitoring. This model is used in the Maths Garden, a web-based monitoring system, which includes a challenging web environment for children to practice arithmetic. Using a new item response model based on the Elo (1978) rating system and an explicit scoring rule, estimates of the ability of persons and the difficulty of items are updated with every answered item, allowing for on the fly item calibration. In the scoring rule both accuracy and response time are accounted for. Items are sampled with a mean success probability of .75, making the tasks challenging yet not too difficult. In a period of ten months our sample of 3648 children completed over 3.5 million arithmetic problems. The children completed about 33% of these problems outside school hours. Results show better measurement precision, high validity and reliability, high pupil satisfaction, and many interesting options for monitoring progress, diagnosing errors and analyzing development.},

The method was validated by showing that item ratings were stable and grade differences in ability were significant. Regression analyses on the item level showed that not only sequence length, but also other characteristics, such as type of task (forward or backward), explained variance in item difficulty. Finally, regression analyses on the child level showed that visuospatial working memory and mathematics were significantly related: especially for addition and subtraction in the lower grades. For multiplication and division this relationship was weaker and without age trend.},

Preferences were associated with gender, age, and ability, matching expectations that follow from the literature. Study 2 is an experimental study with 192 children from grades 3–6, using a pretest, training phase, and posttest. The possibility to choose a success rate was manipulated. Unexpectedly, beneficial effects for math practice, improvement of math skills, and self-belief concerning math were absent. Results suggest an appreciation of the possibility to choose, although beneficial effects of choosing were not observed for motivation to practice, skill improvement, and self-belief concerning math.},

  abstract={Differentiatie, onderwijs op maat afgestemd op het niveau en de behoeftes van de leerling, heeft evidente voordelen. De cognitieve verschillen tussen kinderen, al vroeg op de basisschool, zijn aanzienlijk, en goed onderwijs speelt hierop in.Maar er is ook kritiek. Een risico is dat de verschillen in prestaties tussen de beste en zwakste leerlingen toenemen. Ook wordt het onderwijssysteem steeds ingewikkelder, waarbij kinderen van hoogopgeleide ouders beter de weg vinden dan kinderen van laagopgeleide ouders. Of differentiatie kansenongelijkheid in de hand werkt, hangt onder meer af van de vorm van differentiatie. In dit artikel bespreken we eerst welke rol differentiatie in de vorm van moderne computergebaseerde adaptieve leermethoden hierin speelt. In deze methoden worden technieken uit de artificiële intelligentie (AI) toegepast om oefeningen en instructie op het kind af te stemmen.De Koning stelde voor onderscheid te maken tussen macro-differentiatie (bijvoorbeeld niveaus in het voortgezet onderwijs), meso-differentiatie (gescheiden brugklassen of plusklassen) en micro-differentiatie (differentiatie binnen één klas). Computergebaseerde adaptieve leermethoden vallen in de categorie van de micro-differentiatie. Een recente samenvatting van het onderzoek over differentiatie en kansengelijkheid is te vinden in de oratie van Denessen. In zijn oratie stelde Denessen dat macro- en meso-differentiatie leiden tot grotere kansenongelijkheid maar over micro-differentiatie is hij minder beslist. In het eerste deel van dit essay gaan we hier dieper op in.In het tweede deel gaan we dieper in op het begrip kansengelijkheid. Het onderzoek naar kansengelijkheid is veelal sociologisch geïnspireerd. Als psychologen hebben wij vele vragen bij dit begrip. Daarom eindigen we met een psychologische geïnspireerde kritische discussie van het begrip kansenongelijkheid.},

  abstract={One of the highest ambitions in educational technology is the move towards personalized learning. To this end, computerized adaptive learning (CAL) systems are developed. A popular method to track the development of student ability and item difficulty, in CAL systems, is the Elo Rating System (ERS). The ERS allows for dynamic model parameters by updating key parameters after every response. However, drawbacks of the ERS are that it does not provide standard errors and that it results in rating variance inflation. We identify three statistical issues responsible for both of these drawbacks. To solve these issues we introduce a new tracking system based on urns, where every person and item is represented by an urn filled with a combination of green and red marbles. Urns are updated, by an exchange of marbles after each response, such that the proportions of green marbles represent estimates of person ability or item difficulty. A main advantage of this approach is that the standard errors are known, hence the method allows for statistical inference, such as testing for learning effects. We highlight features of the Urnings algorithm and compare it to the popular ERS in a simulation study and in an empirical data example from a large-scale CAL application.},

  abstract={Online learning environments are well-suited for tailoring the learning experience of children individually and on a large scale. An environment such as Math Garden allows children to practice exercises adapted to their specific mathematical ability; this is thought to maximize their mathematical skills. In the current experiment, we investigated whether learning environments should also consider the differential impact of cognitive load on children’s math performance depending on their individual verbal working memory (WM) and inhibitory control (IC) capacity. A total of 39 children (8–11 years old) performed a multiple-choice computerized arithmetic game. Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions where the visibility of time pressure, a key feature in most gamified learning environments, was manipulated. Results showed that verbal WM was positively associated with arithmetic performance in general but that higher IC predicted better performance only when the time pressure was not visible. This effect was mostly driven by the younger children. Exploratory analyses of eye-tracking data (N = 36) showed that when time pressure was visible, children attended more often to the question (e.g., 6 × 8). In addition, when time pressure was visible, children with lower IC, in particular younger children, attended more often to answer options representing operant confusion (e.g., 9 × 4 = 13) and visited more answer options before responding. These findings suggest that tailoring the visibility of time pressure, based on a child’s individual cognitive profile, could improve arithmetic performance and may in turn improve learning in online learning environments.},

We define trackers as instruments with specific properties to deal with such changing parameters. First, trackers should allow for estimating dynamically changing parameters, adapting to possible changes in ability or item difficulty. Second, if no change occurs for some time, trackers should provide unbiased estimates with a known error variance. Such trackers retain the strengths of both state space models and rating systems, while resolve some of their weaknesses. These properties are especially suitable for educational measurement applications such as tracking individual progress or any aggregate thereof, as in reporting survey research.},

Large-scale, high-stakes, online, anywhere anytime learning and testing inherently comes with a number of unique problems that require new psychometric solutions. These include (1) the cold start problem, (2) problem of change, and (3) the problem of personalization and adaptation. We outline how our proposed method addresses each of these problems.

  year={2021},
  abstract={In learning, errors are ubiquitous and inevitable. As these errors may signal otherwise latent cognitive processes, tutors-and students alike-can greatly benefit from the information they provide. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate the Systematic Error Tracing (SET) model that identifies the possible causes of systematically observed errors in domains where items are susceptible to most or all causes and errors can be explained by multiple causes. We apply the model to single-digit multiplication, a domain that is very suitable for the model, is well-studied, and allows us to analyze over 25,000 error responses from 335 learners. The model, derived from the Ising model popular in physics, makes use of a bigraph that links errors to causes. The error responses were taken from Math Garden, a computerized adaptive practice environment for arithmetic that is widely used in the Netherlands. We discuss and evaluate various model configurations with respect to the ranking of recommendations and calibration of probability estimates. The results show that the SET model outranks a majority vote baseline model when more than a single recommendation is considered. Finally, we contrast the SET model to similar approaches and discuss limitations and implications.},

  year={2021},
  abstract={Valid assessment of understanding of programming concepts in primary school children is essential to implement and improve programming education. Objective: We developed and validated the Computerized Adaptive Programming Concepts Test (CAPCT) with a novel application of Item Response Theory. The CAPCT is a web-based and resource-efficient adaptive assessment of 4489 questions measuring: the understanding of basic sequences, loops, conditions (if & if-else statements), debugging, multiple agents, procedures, and the ability to generalize to a new syntax. Method: Data was collected through an existing online adaptive practice and monitoring system called Math Garden. We collected 14 million responses from 93,341 Dutch children (ages 4 - 13). Findings: The CAPCT demonstrated good psychometric qualities because 75% of the variance in question difficulty was explained by differences in item characteristics. The CAPCT demonstrated robustness against adding new participants and adding new items. Differences in player ability (i.e., understanding of CS concepts) were due to differences in age, gender, the number of items played, and prior mathematical ability. Implications: The CAPCT may be used by teachers to identify the level of programming concept understanding of their pupils, while researchers may use the CAPCT to construct and validate effective teaching resources.},

  abstract={Word-to-text integration (WTI) is the ability to integrate words into a mental representation of the text and is important for reading comprehension, but challenging in English as a second language (ESL). However, it remains unclear whether WTI can be trained in seventh grade ESL learners, who often struggle with reading comprehension and display large individual differences. To pay attention to individual differences, the present study examined an adaptive computer game-based WTI-intervention. The intervention, replacing 50 min of ESL classroom instruction, comprized a 12-week program in which students had to complete WTI-based assignments within four serious games, targeting morphosyntactic awareness, translation of words within sentences, recognizing idioms from words in contexts, and a filler game targeting dictation. The intervention group (n = 164) was compared to a control group (n = 166), who only received regular ESL classroom instruction. Both groups completed the following reading measures: decoding, morphological, and syntactic awareness, WTI (argument and anomaly reading speed and processing), and reading comprehension tasks at the beginning (T1) of the school year and at the end (T2) of the school year. Results demonstrated an intervention effect on decoding and anomaly processing as reflected by an interaction between time (T1 vs. T2) and group (intervention vs. control) in a repeated measures MANOVA. Follow-up mediation analyses for the intervention group only - with game performance as mediators between reading measures at T1 and T2 - indicated that students with better T1 scores on reading measures showed more growth in performance within games. More performance growth within the translation game and the idiom recognition game was related to better reading scores at T2. Both high-achieving and low-achieving students displayed performance growth within games, indicating that a WTI intervention yields promising results for a broad variety of ESL readers.},

  abstract={While response time and accuracy indicate overall performance, their value in uncovering cognitive processes, underlying learning, is limited. A promising online measure, designed to track decision‐making, is computer mouse tracking, where mouse attraction towards different locations may reflect the consideration of alternative response options. Using a speedy arithmetic multiple‐choice game in an online adaptive learning environment, we examined whether mouse movements could reflect arithmetic difficulties when error rates are low. Results showed that mouse movements towards alternative responses in correctly answered questions mapped onto the frequency of errors made in this online learning system. This mapping was stronger for the younger children, as well as for easy arithmetic problems. On an individual level, users showed more mouse movement towards their previously made response errors than towards other alternative options. This opens the possibility of adapting feedback and instruction on an individual basis through mouse tracking.},

  journal={Journal of Writing Research},
  year={2022},
  abstract={In this study, we investigated which spelling cues are used in word-medial consonant spelling by learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Previous research has shown that native speakers of English rely on different cues to decide whether a single (“diner”) or double consonant (“dinner”) needs to be used in word-medial consonant spelling. These cues include phonology, orthography, morphology and lexical frequency. We investigated whether these cues play a similar role in Dutch spellers who are EFL learners, next to similarity of the English target to Dutch. We analyzed dictation task data that was part of an unsupervised digital learning environment for EFL learning. The error analyses revealed that novice EFL spellers mainly used phonological and cross-linguistic cues in consonant doubling. In contrast, more proficient spellers relied less on phonological cues, and relied on morphological cues instead. The EFL spellers did not rely on orthographic cues. Furthermore, spelling difficulty was influenced by the frequency of a word and its similarity with the native-language equivalent, in terms of cognate status (non-cognate/cognate) and consonant doubling. Together, our findings indicate that a higher number of converging cues facilitates spelling for EFL spellers and that their reliance on cues changes as spelling proficiency increases.},

  abstract={Education can be viewed as a control theory problem in which students seek ongoing exogenous input—either through traditional classroom teaching or other alternative training resources—to minimize the discrepancies between their actual and target (reference) performance levels. Using illustrative data from  Dutch elementary school students as measured using the Math Garden, a web-based computer adaptive practice and monitoring system, we simulate and evaluate the outcomes of using off-line and finite memory linear quadratic controllers with constraintsto forecast students’ optimal training durations. By integrating population standards with each student’s own latent change information, we demonstrate that adoption of the control theory-guided, person- and time-specific training dosages could yield increased training benefits at reduced costs compared to students’ actual observed training durations, and a fixed-duration training scheme. The control theory approach also outperforms a linear scheme that provides training recommendations based on observed scores under noisy and the presence of missing data. Design-related issues such as ways to determine the penalty cost of input administration and the size of the control horizon window are addressed through a series of illustrative and empirically (Math Garden) motivated simulations.},

  abstract={The ability to monitor and adjust our performance is crucial for adaptive behaviour, a key component of human cognitive control. One widely studied metric of this behaviour is post‐error slowing (PES), the finding that humans tend to slow down their performance after making an error. This study is a first attempt at generalizing the effect of PES to an online adaptive learning environment where children practise mathematics and language skills. This population was of particular interest since the major development of error processing occurs during childhood. Eight million response patterns were collected from 150,000 users aged 5 to 13 years old for 6 months, across 23 different learning activities. PES could be observed in most learning activities and greater PES was associated with greater post‐error accuracy. PES also varied as a function of several variables. At the task level, PES was greater when there was less time pressure, when errors were slower, and in learning activities focusing on mathematical rather than language skills. At the individual level, students who chose the most difficult level to practise and had higher skill ability also showed greater PES. Finally, non‐linear developmental differences in error processing were found, where the PES magnitude increased from 6 to 9‐years‐old and decreased from 9 to 13. This study shows that PES underlies adaptive behaviour in an educational context for primary school students.},

  abstract={We introduce a new rating system for tracking the development of parameters based on a stream of observations that can be viewed as paired comparisons. Rating systems are applied in competitive games, adaptive learning systems and platforms for product and service reviews. We model each observation as an outcome of a game of chance that depends on the parameters of interest (e.g. the outcome of a chess game depends on the abilities of the two players). Determining the probabilities of the different game outcomes is conceptualized as an urn problem, where a rating is represented by a probability (i.e. proportion of balls in the urn). This setup allows for evaluating the standard errors of the ratings and performing statistical inferences about the development of, and relations between, parameters. Theoretical properties of the system in terms of the invariant distributions of the ratings and their convergence are derived. The properties of the rating system are illustrated with simulated examples and its potential for answering research questions is illustrated using data from competitive chess, a movie review system, and an adaptive learning system for math.},

  abstract={Recently, the Urnings algorithm (Bolsinova et al.,  2022, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. C Appl. Statistics, 71, 91) has been proposed that allows for tracking the development of abilities of the learners and the difficulties of the items in adaptive learning systems. It is a simple and scalable algorithm which is suited for large‐scale applications in which large streams of data are coming into the system and on‐the‐fly updating is needed. Compared to alternatives like the Elo rating system and its extensions, the Urnings rating system allows the uncertainty of the ratings to be evaluated and accounts for adaptive item selection which, if not corrected for, may distort the ratings. In this paper we extend the Urnings algorithm to allow for both between‐item and within‐item multidimensionality. This allows for tracking the development of interrelated abilities both at the individual and the population level. We present formal derivations of the multidimensional Urnings algorithm, illustrate its properties in simulations, and present an application to data from an adaptive learning system for primary school mathematics called Math Garden.},

Thereby EMME help guide learners' attention towards the relevant information and can model cognitive strategies which are otherwise unobservable for learners. This study investigated whether EMME can help to learn deductive reasoning strategies and how the presence/absence of a teacher's verbal explanation affects learning from EMME. Secondary education students (N = 137) were randomly assigned to study video examples under one of four conditions in a 2 (EMME: yes/no) x 2 (verbal explanations: yes/no) between‐subjects design. Results revealed only a beneficial effect of the presence of verbal explanations on performance on the practice problems, but no pretest‐to‐posttest learning gains. Seeing the teacher's eye movements does not appear to enhance learning of deductive reasoning. The presence/absence of the teacher's verbal explanation does not seem to affect learning deductive reasoning.},

  abstract={Math learning programs were expected to revolutionize students’ learning, but their effects so far have mostly been disappointing. Following the debate about why to continue research on math learning programs, we aimed to reformulate this question into how to continue this research. Investigations to date have neither considered a sufficiently wide set of outcome variables nor differentiated between performance measures (e.g., measuring addition and subtraction performance separately) and affective-motivational variables. Moreover, as students can only benefit from a program if they use it, researchers need to take practice behavior into account. Thus, we investigated whether the adaptive arithmetic learning program Math Garden fostered students’ addition and subtraction performance, their math self-concept, and a reduction of their math anxiety. We also investigated how practice behavior (practiced tasks/weeks) affected these outcomes. We used a randomized pretest-posttest control group design with 376 fifth-grade students in Germany. Students in the experimental condition practiced with Math Garden for 20.7 weeks and had an increase in math self-concept. The more subtraction tasks the students practiced, the more they improved their subtraction performance. We found no effects on math anxiety. The results are discussed in terms of providing a starting point for new directions in future research.},

  abstract={Effort is key in learning, as evidenced by its omnipresence in both empirical findings and educational theory. At the same time, students are consistently found to avoid effort. In this study, we investigate whether limiting effort avoidance improves learning outcomes. We also examine differences in learning outcomes for a substantive typology of students: toilers (practice many problems), skippers (skip many problems), and rushers (provide fast responses). In a large-scale computer adaptive practice system for primary education, over 1 50 000 participants were distributed across four conditions in which a problem-skipping option was delayed by 0, 3, 6, or 9 s. The results show that after a 14-week period, there are no average treatment effects on learning outcomes across conditions. Also, no consistent conditional average treatment effects are found across the typology. However, different types of students have different learning outcomes, showing that the typology used is meaningful. We conclude that the scale of the experiment suggests a precise null finding, but caution that this should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect. Problem-skipping restrictions may require a longer-lasting implementation to accumulate the desired effect.},

However, teachers may ask children to collaborate on single player tasks as well, given a scarcity of available computers in the classroom or assuming that children can learn from each other and motivate each other. In the current study, we studied the conversations of primary school children (N = 64; 39 girls, 25 boys) working together in dyads in an adaptive single-player math learning environment (Math Garden). We aimed to investigate (1) how dyads collaborate across two math tasks aimed at practicing different math skills (arithmetic vs. reasoning skills) embedded within Math Garden and (2) whether collaborative activities differed across the two math tasks. We studied both individual utterances as well as episodes of social metacognitive interactions between the dyad members. We found that children engaged in activities important for successful collaboration, such as relational and metacognitive activities. Moreover, we identified social metacognitive episodes, meaning that children regulated their groups’ learning and that the regulatory processes which took part within the collaborative learning session cannot be reduced to individual activities. We conclude that children engage in collaborative activities when working together on single player tasks. And, in line with previous research, these collaborative activities differed across games, highlighting that collaborative learning is shaped by the task at hand.},

  abstract={The Elo rating system (ERS), an intuitive and computationally efficient algorithm, offers a means to effectively update estimates of item difficulties and learner abilities as they evolve. This method proves to be highly advantageous in online learning environments. Computerized adaptive practice (CAP) endeavors to present learners with items that are well-suited to their individual ability levels, with the ultimate goal of enhancing motivation and optimizing learning outcomes. The objective of this paper is to outline common challenges that arise in an Elo-based CAP system and to present the psychometric enhancements implemented in the Prowise Learn environments to address these concerns. More specifically, we focus on three main aspects; 1) the development of a new scoring rule balancing response time and accuracy, 2) a way to fix the item scale to deal with item drift, and 3) an improved adaptive K-factor algorithm to speed up convergence in estimation. Using data from the Prowise Learn environment, analyses were done to illustrate the effect of the enhancements. Results show that these enhancements result in more dynamic tracking of the ratings, solve the issue of item drift, and capture the speed-accuracy trade-off more accurately.},
